            <p class= 'bg-white outline'>
                Being a  barber for 5 years has really allowed me to explore and test out new clippers and trimmers. There are plenty of options out there to choose from and can become quite nerve wrecking for beginner with a small budget. Today we will talk about the different kinds of clippers as well as some recommendations from me.

                When it comes to clippers, there is a plentiful to choose from. Basically, they can all be broken down into two categories:
                Clippers and Trimmers. Looking into each catergorie with a bit a depth youll see that both are used to achieve different things.

                Clippers are you traditional machine everyone is fimiliar with. These are your main tool used to cut down bulk in the hair and fade the hair as well. They also have an adjustment lever to get very detailed fades.

                Trimmers are the smaller clipper usually used to outline the neckline and front hairline as well. These trimmer have a set blade which can make them very sharp and not useful for fading.
